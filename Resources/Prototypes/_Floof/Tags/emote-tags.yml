# The process of adding one of these tags is as follows:
# 1. Define a new tag prototype
# 2. Go to the species base mob prototype (e.g. BaseMobMoth)
# 3. Check if it already has a TagComponent
# 4.1. If it doesn't, then go to the parent of the mob (usually BaseMobSpeciesOrganic) and check if it has a TagComponent, repeat until you find it
# 4.2. Copy the tag component from the first parent that defines it onto the base mob.
# 5. Add the tag to the TagComponent
#
# I won't bother adding such tags for all species specifically because it requires overriding the parent's TagComponent,
# and that can and WILL cause issues if upstream decides to add new tags to species mobs.
